                <p> I'm driven by the challenge of uncovering innovative technological and people-focused solutions to modern-day problems. By honing my analytical skills and defining the big picture challenges, I'm able to pinpoint meaningful solutions through collaboration.</p>
                <p>I belive the secret to success is having a team of well-informed, adaptive individuals who are not only willing to adapt to new insights, but also able to identify and make micro improvements to everyday tasks.</p>
                <p>It's not true that practice makes perfect. The practice of perfection makes perfect.</p>
